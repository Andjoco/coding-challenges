# Challenge

Let’s practice some of the traversing methods.

Download **Panel.zip** from the lesson folder and extract locally. Open the folder in Sublime. Bring up **button.html** in a browser.

**Challenge A**: Write jQuery code to perform the following (add to **style.js**):

- When a coloured panel is clicked, all panels vanish.
- When a coloured panel is clicked, just that panel vanishes.
- When a panel is clicked, all siblings fade to 10% opacity.
- When reset is clicked, all panels revert to full opacity.
- When the mouse hovers over a panel, that panel turns black (new CSS class would be helpful here ).
- When the mouse moves away, the panel reverts back to its previous colour.

**Challenge B**: Return to the table challenge.

When a table header is clicked, the corresponding row should highlight.

- When another table header (on the row) is clicked, the corresponding row should highlight and all others should turn white.
- Add extra rows if you need to.
- Traverse the DOM to find a solution.

**Challenge C**:

- Change the text in the reset button to display the colour (RGB) of the selected panel.
