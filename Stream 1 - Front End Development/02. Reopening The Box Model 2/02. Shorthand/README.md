# Challenge

Now that you have seen how block and inline-block can work, we can get cracking on some real layouts.

Continuing from the last walk through code that you have written, try and replicate the following layouts:

Make block- level and make the width 100%:

Remove background color:

Add headings & center them (text-align:center):

Here is the real challenge – create the layout as shown below:

- Create id’s for the Sidebar and Content.
- Make them inline-block and give them a height of 320px.
- Remove all margins from .box class for the moment.
- Maths time – perform the width calculation to fit them inside the 960px container.
- Remember the margins (left and right). Because we are using inline-block for styling, we need the .container class to have font-size=0.
- The box class should have a font-size greater than 0.

If you have managed to create the above layout, well done!
Save your work, it will be needed again.

*Optional:*

If you want to put the sidebar a little more to the left side, as shown below, go ahead!
