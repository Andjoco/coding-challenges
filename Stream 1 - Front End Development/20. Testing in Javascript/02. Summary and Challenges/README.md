**Drink About**

Write some tests for the following:

Drink About is a simple function that will check the age and return a drink for the appropriate age. Create a function called whatCanIDrink. This function should take in age as parameter. The function should do the following:

- If the age is less than 0, then it should return “Sorry. I can’t tell what drink because that age is incorrect!”
- If the age is less than 14, then it should return “Drink Toddy”.
- If the age is less than 18, then it should return “Drink Coke”.
- If the age is less than 21, then it should return “Drink Beer”.
- If the age is less than 130, then it should return “Drink Whisky”.
- Else return “Sorry. I can’t tell what drink because that age is incorrect!”

**FizzBuzz**

Write some tests for the following:

FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem that is often asked as an interview question. Create a function called fizzBuzz. This function should take in number as a parameter. The function should to the following:

- If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, then return “FizzBuzz”.
- If the number is divisible by 3, then return “Fizz”.
- If the number is divisible by 5, then return “Buzz”.
- Else just return the number.
- Note: The modulo operator (%) will be able to determine if the number is divisible by 3 or 5. For example, if (number % 3 && number % 5) {return “FizzBuzz”;}
- Write a test that passes in every number between 0 and 100 to the FizzBuzz function and ensure that the function meets the above requirements.
